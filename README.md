Submitted by: **Shirin Mahajan**

### If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

I used https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp which is the popular w3 schools website. This is following a note in the instructions saying we are allowed to use external resources. 

### What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

I ran into slight errors with the CSS file. The main challenge was that I was out of practice with the syntax used in CSS, however, I was quickly able to brush up my skills using the w3schools learning website. To be specific, I was slightly rusty on keywords (padding, margin etc), and what exactly they affected on the webpage. The other challenge was regarding the JavaScript file. I was comfortable with the syntax and the language, however, I had a small bump in the road working with sounds because this was a first for me. 

I overcame these challenges by continuously testing my code in a Safari window side by side. This was especially helpful while working on the CSS file because I can instantly see what I am affecting on the webpage, and it was actually quite fun messing around with the styling before settling on the requirements. As for the JavaScript code, constant testing was the best method of perfecting my code. I made sure to test every scenario to replicate exactly what Is shown in the videos and photos provided in the instructions for the task. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this task, and it reignited my love for web development! I certainly plan to create more personal projects using the new skills I learnt, particularly sound!

### What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

My biggest question is: How can I convert this game into a Progressive Web App (PWA) so it works offline? I have created games in the past, such as an SAT vocabulary mastery game, and now I am intrigued by the possibility of taking my web apps, and converting them into offline games. 

Another question, I'd like to investigate in my own time is: What are the differences between CSS Grid and Flexbox, and which would be better for game layout? Does the choice between the two change as we add different features, upgrades, and changes to a game? Is there one that is always a safer choice? 

Lastly, I would love to add fun verbal feedback! My question would be: How could I include animated voices announcing "Game Over" or "Good Job!"? I think this would really enhance the user experience and be entertaining.

### If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

If I had more time to work on this project, I would focus on adding difficulty levels to enhance gameplay. A great starting point would be optimizing timing constants so they dynamically adjust. For example, to increase difficulty, I would gradually decrease clueHoldTime as the game progresses. Additionally, instead of an automatic difficulty increase, I would consider giving users the option to select their difficulty level at the start of the game.

I would also refactor the code by implementing event delegation rather than assigning onclick handlers to each button individually. This would make the code more scalable and efficient, especially if I decide to add more game buttons or mechanics in the future.

Another exciting addition would be multiplayer functionality and a leaderboard system. Multiplayer modes significantly increase a game's engagement by adding a competitive edge, making players more invested. A leaderboard would further enhance this by encouraging users to improve their scores and track their rankings. A great example is Candy Crush, where my father continues to play even today because he enjoys checking and maintaining his leaderboard position. This simple yet powerful feature keeps players coming back, making it an excellent upgrade for my game.
